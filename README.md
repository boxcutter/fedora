# Packer templates for Fedora written in legacy JSON

### Overview

This repository contains Packer templates for creating Fedora Vagrant boxes written in legacy JSON.

## Current Boxes

We no longer provide pre-built binaries for these templates.

## Building the Vagrant boxes with Packer

To build all the boxes, you will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads),
[VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion)/[VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation) and
[Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/whats-new/) installed.

Parallels requires that the
[Parallels Virtualization SDK for Mac](http://www.parallels.com/downloads/desktop)
be installed as an additional prerequisite.

We make use of JSON files containing user variables to build specific versions of Fedora.
You tell `packer` to use a specific user variable file via the `-var-file=` command line
option.  This will override the default options on the core `fedora.json` packer template,
which builds Fedora 25 by default.

For example, to build Fedora 28 Server, use the following:

    $ packer build -var-file=fedora28-server.json fedora.json

If you want to make boxes for a specific desktop virtualization platform, use the `-only`
parameter.  For example, to build Fedora 28 Server for VirtualBox:

    $ packer build -only=virtualbox-iso -var-file=fedora28-server.json fedora.json

The boxcutter templates currently support the following desktop virtualization strings:

* `parallels-iso` - [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/whats-new/) desktop virtualization (Requires the Pro Edition - Desktop edition won't work)
* `virtualbox-iso` - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) desktop virtualization
* `vmware-iso` - [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) or [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation) desktop virtualization

## Building the Vagrant boxes with the box script

We've also provided a wrapper script `bin/box` for ease of use, so alternatively, you can use
the following to build Fedora 28 for all providers:

    $ bin/box build fedora28

Or if you just want to build Fedora 28 for VirtualBox:

    $ bin/box build fedora28 virtualbox

## Building the Vagrant boxes with the Makefile

A GNU Make `Makefile` drives a complete basebox creation pipeline with the following stages:

* `build` - Create basebox `*.box` files
* `assure` - Verify that the basebox `*.box` files produced function correctly
* `deliver` - Upload `*.box` files to [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Vagrant+Repositories), [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) or an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

The pipeline is driven via the following targets, making it easy for you to include them
in your favourite CI tool:

    make build   # Build all available box types
    make assure  # Run tests against all the boxes
    make deliver # Upload box artifacts to a repository
    make clean   # Clean up build detritus

### Proxy Settings

The templates respect the following network proxy environment variables
and forward them on to the virtual machine environment during the box creation
process, should you be using a proxy:

* http_proxy
* https_proxy
* ftp_proxy
* rsync_proxy
* no_proxy

### Tests

The tests are written in [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org) and require the
`vagrant-serverspec` plugin to be installed with:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-serverspec

The `Makefile` has individual targets for each box type with the prefix
`test-*` should you wish to run tests individually for each box.

    make test-virtualbox/fedora22

Similarly there are targets with the prefix `ssh-*` for registering a
newly-built box with vagrant and for logging in using just one command to
do exploratory testing.  For example, to do exploratory testing
on the VirtualBox training environment, run the following command:

    make ssh-virtualbox/fedora22

Upon logout `make ssh-*` will automatically de-register the box as well.

### Makefile.local override

You can create a `Makefile.local` file alongside the `Makefile` to override
some of the default settings.  The variables can that can be currently
used are:

* CM
* CM_VERSION
* HEADLESS
* \<iso_path\>
* UPDATE

`Makefile.local` is most commonly used to override the default configuration
management tool, for example with Chef:

    # Makefile.local
    CM := chef

Changing the value of the `CM` variable changes the target suffixes for
the output of `make list` accordingly.

Possible values for the CM variable are:

* `nocm` - No configuration management tool
* `chef` - Install Chef
* `puppet` - Install Puppet
* `salt`  - Install Salt

You can also specify a variable `CM_VERSION`, if supported by the
configuration management tool, to override the default of `latest`.
The value of `CM_VERSION` should have the form `x.y` or `x.y.z`,
such as `CM_VERSION := 11.12.4`

The variable `UPDATE` can be used to perform OS patch management.  The
default is to not apply OS updates by default.  When `UPDATE := true`,
the latest OS updates will be applied.

The variable `HEADLESS` can be set to run Packer in headless mode.
Set `HEADLESS := true`, the default is false.

The variable `PACKER` can be used to set the path to the packer binary.
The default is `packer`.

The variable `ISO_PATH` can be used to set the path to a directory with
OS install images.  This override is commonly used to speed up Packer
builds by pointing at pre-downloaded ISOs instead of using the default
download Internet URLs.
